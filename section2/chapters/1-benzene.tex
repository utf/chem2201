\section{Aromaticity}

Benzene is very stable and therefore it does not behave like alkenes.
Rather than undergoing addition reactions, it undergoes substitution reactions.\\

H\"uckels rule: A planar, fully conjugated cyclic compound with 4n+2 electrons is aromatic.
However we can also have 3, 5, 7 and 8 carbon aromatic compounds.

\subsection{Reactions of Benzene}

The typical reaction of bezene is electrophilic substitution, one of the H's is replaced by an electrophile:

\img{1-4}

Because of the stabilised intermediate, the 1\dec\ is no good for friedel crafts acylation or alkylation therefore the reaction is different, using DMF and phosphorus oxychloride.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

  \item Vilsmeier--Haack Formylation

    \img{1-5}

    Mechanism:

    \img{1-6}

  \item Dealkylation

    E.g. Removal of tertiary alkyl group with protic acid.
    Reverse of Friedel crafts alkylation.

    \img[Position of equilibrium depends on reaction conditions]{1-7}

  \item Diazo coupling

    React aromatic diazonium ion with phenol or aniline (e.g. Electron rich aromitc) to get azo compounds.

    \img{1-8}

    Azo compounds have 2 aromatic groups either side of \ce{-(N=N)-}

\subsection{Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substition}

Substituents will influence rate and position:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

  \item Activating - Ortho/Para directing
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Alkyl Groups
      \item Oxygen substituents
      \item Nitrogen substituents (\ce{NH2}, \ce{NR2}, \ce{NHCOR})
        I.e. Electron donating hence activating, either inductively or resonance.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Deactivating - Meta directing
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nitro groups and nitriles
      \item Carbonyl groups (\ce{COR}, \ce{CO2R})
      \item Positively charged substituents (\ce{NR3+})
        I.e. Electron withdrawing and therefore deactivating.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Deactivating - Ortho/Para directing
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Halogen atoms - inductively electron withdrawing but donating through resonance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
