The basic principles of addition to \ce{C=O} groupsa are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How reactive is the \ce{C=O} group
  \item How reactive is the nucleophile
  \item Which is more reactive, the starting material or the product (Example 3)
  \item Will an unreactive \ce{C=O} need activation (e.g. \ce{H+})? If the
    nucleophile is unreactive?
  \item Can \ce{H2O} be eliminated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example Reactions}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Reduction of aldehyde with \ce{NaBH4}
    \img[No further reactions can take place as there are no leaving groups]{1-7}
    This reaction will not take place with esters as the electrophile is not
    sufficiently reactive. Instead use \ce{LiAlH4}\\

  \item Carboxylic acid from acid chloride with NaOH
    \img[Cl is a good leaving group therefore there is a further reaction\\]{1-8}

  \item Ester with a grignard reagent
    \img{1-9}

  \item Addition of water
    \img{1-10}
    Poor electrophile and poor nucleophile therefore the
    \ce{C=O} group is activated by adding water.

  \item Elimination of \ce{H2O}
    \img{1-11}
    Reasonable electrophile and a poor nucleophile therefore activation of
    \ce{C=O} required.

  \item Elimination of \ce{H2O} using methylamine
    \img{1-12}
    Reasonable electrophile and poor nucleophile therefore activation of
    \ce{C=O} required.
\end{enumerate}
