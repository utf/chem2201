\section{Enols and Enolates}

\img{2-1}

Formation of an enol using acid + ketone

\img{2-2}

\subsection{Example Reactions}

Enol + DCl + \ce{D2O}

\img[\ce{H -> D} exchange takes place at the $\alpha$-position]{2-3}

Enol +  Acid and \ce{Br2}

\img[Forms a brominated ketone]{2-4}

Enolate formation using base + ketone

\img{2-5}

Enolate formation from esters

\img{2-6}

Enolate formation with diketone

\img{2-7}

Order of stability goes C > B > A\\

Enolate with \ce{Br2} + base

\img{2-8}

For compounds with $\alpha$-H's:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Central protons are easier to remove as this further delocalises the
    negative charge.
  \item The pKa of the base must be no higher than the compound to deprotonate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aldol Reaction}
